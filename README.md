# Project Overview:  

Conducted a two-sample hypothesis test (t-test) to analyze the difference in the mean amount of rides between iPhone users and Android users.

$H_0$: There is no difference in average number of drives between drivers who use iPhone devices and drivers who use Androids.  

$H_A$: There is a difference in average number of drives between drivers who use iPhone devices and drivers who use Androids.  
A two-sample t-test with 5% as the significance level  

Key insight: that drivers who use iPhone devices on average have a similar number of drives as those who use Androids.
